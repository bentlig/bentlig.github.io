<h1>Setting the Stage</h1>
<p>Coding is a lot like being involved in theater. You need a director (in this case, JavaScript), a stage (your project), a makeup artist (CSS), and a cast. For JavaScript, variables are your actors (which have no brains and must be told exactly where to stand, what to say, etc.). Variables have to be defined before they can interact with the director. A variable can be a string value (abv: str - a group of characters put together between quotation marks; ex "grapes", "gr4pes", etc.), a floating point value (abv: float - a decimal number; ex 3.14), or an integer (abv: int - a whole number within a specific range that I cant find right now; ex 2 or 500). To define a variable, you would type "var ___ = ___". Ex: var fruit = "grapes"; var circumference = 3.14; var amount = 400.</p>
